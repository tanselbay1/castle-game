## About

This game was created for the [TOP Jam 1- Edutainment](https://itch.io/jam/top-jam-1), which was a game jam hosted by The Odin Project, where teams of a maximum of 4 had to create a game with the theme of education and entertainment. Each team had around a month to complete the game. The game had to be DOM only (no HTML canvas) and use tech taught by or closely related to The Odin Project, so no game frameworks like Unity or Phaser.js were allowed. At the end of the game jam, each game was scored on different criteria by a group of judges.

There was a forum given to everyone who wanted to participate, so that we could assemble a team together. We formed our team and decided to create a discord so that we could communicate with each other. In the lead up to the start date of the game jam, we setup a trello board so that we could assign each other tickets, helping us to stay organised. Throughout the process, we made sure to keep communicating with each other, which was hard at times due to the different time zones, but we overcame that by agreeing on a set time when we could all meet up on Discord to chat. It was a hard process for all of us, but we made sure to keep at it, to plan well, and help each other along the way. In the end, we achieved 4th place of #fun, #theme, #educational value and 5th place of #overall; which we are all very proud of.
